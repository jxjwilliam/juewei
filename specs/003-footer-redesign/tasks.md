# Tasks: Footer Redesign

**Feature**: Footer Redesign  
**Branch**: `003-footer-redesign`  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Summary

This document contains actionable, dependency-ordered tasks for implementing the footer redesign feature. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1, P2) and include setup, foundational, and implementation phases.

**Total Tasks**: 24  
**User Story 1 (P1)**: 8 tasks  
**User Story 2 (P1)**: 6 tasks  
**User Story 3 (P2)**: 5 tasks  
**User Story 4 (P2)**: 5 tasks

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:
1. **User Story 1** (Modern Footer Design) - Can be implemented independently
2. **User Story 2** (Enhanced Visual Hierarchy) - Depends on User Story 1
