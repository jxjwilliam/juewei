# Implementation Plan: Footer Redesign

**Branch**: `003-footer-redesign` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [Footer Redesign Spec](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-footer-redesign/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Modernize the Juewei website footer with improved visual hierarchy, enhanced mobile experience, and brand consistency while maintaining all existing functionality. The redesign will focus on modern styling, better spacing, and responsive design using the existing Tailwind CSS design system and shadcn/ui components.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5, React 18, Next.js 15  
**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS 4.x, shadcn/ui, Lucide React icons, Next.js Image optimization  
**Storage**: N/A (static footer content)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E testing  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with responsive design  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js 15 with App Router)  
**Performance Goals**: Footer loads within 2 seconds, 95% brand alignment, 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing functionality, support Chinese/English content, preserve all links and contact information  
**Scale/Scope**: Single footer component with responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**✅ PASSED**: All constitution requirements met
- **Library-First**: Footer component is self-contained and independently testable
- **CLI Interface**: N/A (UI component, not CLI tool)
- **Test-First**: Footer component will have comprehensive tests for visual hierarchy, responsiveness, and accessibility
- **Integration Testing**: Footer integration tests will verify proper rendering across devices and language support
- **Observability**: Footer performance and accessibility metrics will be tracked
- **Versioning**: Component follows semantic versioning with the main application
- **Simplicity**: Footer redesign maintains existing functionality while improving visual design

**✅ RE-CHECKED AFTER PHASE 1**: All constitution requirements continue to be met
- **Design Phase Complete**: Data model, contracts, and quickstart guide created
- **Agent Context Updated**: Cursor IDE context updated with new technology stack
- **API Contracts**: OpenAPI specification created for footer data structure
- **Implementation Ready**: All design artifacts completed and ready for development

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure with Next.js 15 App Router. The footer component is located in `/components/footer.tsx` and will be redesigned while maintaining the existing project structure. All dependencies and utilities are already in place.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
