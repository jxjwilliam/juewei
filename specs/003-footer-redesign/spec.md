# Feature Specification: Footer Redesign

**Feature Branch**: `003-footer-redesign`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "improve footer, current it looks ugly."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Modern Footer Design (Priority: P1)

Users visiting the Juewei website need a visually appealing and professional footer that enhances the overall brand experience and provides easy access to important information.

**Why this priority**: The footer is the final impression users have of the website and serves as a critical navigation and contact hub. A modern, well-designed footer directly impacts brand perception and user engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by implementing a redesigned footer with improved visual hierarchy, better spacing, and modern styling that maintains all existing functionality while enhancing the user experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits any page on the website, **When** they scroll to the footer, **Then** they see a modern, visually appealing footer with clear visual hierarchy
2. **Given** a user is viewing the footer, **When** they look for contact information, **Then** they can easily find and read contact details with proper spacing and typography
3. **Given** a user wants to navigate to other pages, **When** they use the footer navigation links, **Then** the links are clearly visible and properly styled

### User Story 2 - Enhanced Visual Hierarchy (Priority: P1)

Users need a footer with clear visual hierarchy that makes it easy to scan and find relevant information quickly.

**Why this priority**: Poor visual hierarchy in the current footer makes it difficult for users to quickly find the information they need, leading to poor user experience and potential loss of engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing improved typography, spacing, and visual grouping that creates clear information hierarchy without changing the underlying content structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user scans the footer, **When** they look for different types of information, **Then** they can easily distinguish between contact info, navigation, and social media sections
2. **Given** a user views the footer on mobile, **When** they need to find specific information, **Then** the layout adapts appropriately with clear visual separation

---

### User Story 3 - Improved Mobile Experience (Priority: P2)

Mobile users need a footer that works well on smaller screens with appropriate spacing, readable text, and touch-friendly interactions.

**Why this priority**: Mobile users represent a significant portion of website traffic, and the current footer may not provide optimal mobile experience, affecting user satisfaction and engagement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing responsive design improvements that ensure the footer works well across all device sizes while maintaining functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a mobile user views the footer, **When** they interact with footer elements, **Then** all elements are appropriately sized for touch interaction
2. **Given** a mobile user scrolls through the footer, **When** they view different sections, **Then** the content is properly spaced and readable without horizontal scrolling

---

### User Story 4 - Brand Consistency (Priority: P2)

Users expect the footer to reflect the Juewei brand identity with consistent colors, typography, and design elements that match the rest of the website.

**Why this priority**: Brand consistency across all website elements builds trust and recognition, while inconsistent design in the footer can create a jarring user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by implementing brand-consistent styling that aligns with the overall website design system and food brand identity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user views the footer, **When** they compare it to other website sections, **Then** the design elements, colors, and typography are consistent with the brand identity
2. **Given** a user interacts with footer elements, **When** they experience hover states and interactions, **Then** the behavior is consistent with other website components

### Edge Cases
