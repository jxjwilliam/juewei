**Component**: `/components/footer.tsx`  
**Analysis Type**: Current Structure and Improvement Areas

## Current Structure Analysis

### Component Overview
The current footer component is a functional React component that provides comprehensive footer functionality for the Juewei website. It includes contact information, navigation links, business hours, social media integration, and trust badges.

### Current Implementation Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Content**: Includes all necessary footer elements
2. **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS with responsive grid system
3. **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML structure with headings and navigation
4. **Social Media Integration**: QR codes and links for multiple platforms
5. **Multi-language Support**: Chinese content with proper font handling
6. **Trust Indicators**: CFIA certification and local business badges

### Current Implementation Issues

#### 1. Visual Hierarchy Problems
- **Poor Typography Scale**: Inconsistent heading sizes and weights
- **Weak Visual Separation**: Limited use of borders, spacing, and background colors
- **Information Density**: Too much information packed without clear grouping
- **Color Contrast**: Some text may not meet accessibility standards

#### 2. Layout and Spacing Issues
- **Inconsistent Spacing**: Uneven gaps between sections and elements
- **Grid Alignment**: 4-column layout may not work well on all screen sizes
- **Content Overflow**: Social media section may overflow on smaller screens
- **Trust Badges**: Poorly integrated with main content flow

#### 3. Mobile Experience Problems
- **Touch Targets**: Some interactive elements may be too small for mobile
- **Text Readability**: Font sizes may be too small on mobile devices
- **Layout Stacking**: Single column layout may not be optimal

#### 4. Brand Consistency Issues
- **Color Palette**: Limited use of brand colors and food-themed styling
- **Typography**: Not fully aligned with overall website typography
- **Visual Elements**: Missing brand-specific design elements
- **Hover States**: Inconsistent interaction feedback

#### 5. Performance and Accessibility
- **Image Loading**: No lazy loading for social media QR codes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Limited focus management
- **Screen Reader**: Could benefit from better ARIA labels
- **Loading States**: No handling for slow-loading images
