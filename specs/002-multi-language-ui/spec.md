# Feature Specification: Multi-Language UI Support

**Feature Branch**: `002-multi-language-ui`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add multiple languages supports UI: 简体中文，繁体中文，English."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How should the language dropdown behave when users interact with it? → A: Standard dropdown with click-to-open, click-outside-to-close behavior

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Language Selection in Navigation (Priority: P1)

Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu in the top navigation bar, supporting 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese), 繁体中文 (Traditional Chinese), and English.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables multi-language support. Without this, users cannot access content in their preferred language.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a language dropdown to the navigation bar and verifying that users can select between the three supported languages. The selection should persist across page navigation and browser sessions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any page of the website, **When** they click the language dropdown in the navigation bar, **Then** they see three language options: 简体中文, 繁体中文, and English
2. **Given** a user has selected a language, **When** they navigate to a different page, **Then** their language preference is maintained
3. **Given** a user has selected a language, **When** they refresh the page or return later, **Then** their language preference is remembered

### User Story 2 - Navigation Menu Translation (Priority: P2)

Navigation menu items (Home, Products, About Us, Contact, Partnership) are displayed in the user's selected language.

**Why this priority**: Navigation is essential for user experience and must be translated to be meaningful to users in their preferred language.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching languages and verifying that all navigation menu items display in the correct language for each supported language.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has selected 简体中文, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see "首页", "产品", "关于我们", "联系我们", "合作下单"
2. **Given** a user has selected 繁体中文, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see "首頁", "產品", "關於我們", "聯繫我們", "合作下單"
3. **Given** a user has selected English, **When** they view the navigation menu, **Then** they see "Home", "Products", "About Us", "Contact", "Partnership"

### User Story 3 - Language Persistence (Priority: P3)

User's language selection is saved and restored across browser sessions and page navigation.

**Why this priority**: Users expect their preferences to be remembered for a better user experience, reducing the need to re-select their language on each visit.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a language, closing the browser, reopening the website, and verifying the language preference is maintained.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user selects a language, **When** they close and reopen their browser, **Then** their language preference is maintained
2. **Given** a user has a saved language preference, **When** they visit the website, **Then** the interface loads in their preferred language without requiring selection

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user's browser doesn't support localStorage?
- How does the system handle invalid language codes in localStorage?
- What happens if the language context fails to load?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a language dropdown in the top navigation bar with three options: 简体中文, 繁体中文, and English
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement standard dropdown behavior: click to open, click outside to close, with keyboard navigation support
- **FR-002**: System MUST update navigation menu items to display in the user's selected language
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist language selection in browser localStorage
- **FR-004**: System MUST restore language preference on page load from localStorage
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain language selection across page navigation
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide fallback to default language (简体中文) if no preference is saved
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle language switching without page reload
- **FR-008**: System MUST display current language selection in the dropdown interface

### Key Entities

- **Language Selection**: User's chosen language preference, stored in localStorage with key "language"
- **Navigation Items**: Menu items that require translation (Home, Products, About Us, Contact, Partnership)
- **Language Context**: React context that provides current language state and translation functions

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can switch between all three supported languages in under 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: Language preference persists across 100% of browser sessions when localStorage is available
- **SC-003**: Navigation menu items display correctly in all three supported languages
- **SC-004**: Language selection is maintained across 100% of page navigation within the same session
- **SC-005**: System gracefully handles localStorage unavailability with fallback to default language
- **SC-006**: Language dropdown is accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Assumptions

- Users have JavaScript enabled in their browsers
- The existing language context system can be extended to support Traditional Chinese
- Navigation menu items are the primary content requiring translation at this time
- The language dropdown will be positioned in the top navigation bar as specified
- Traditional Chinese translations will be provided for navigation items
- The existing language switcher component can be modified to support the new language options
