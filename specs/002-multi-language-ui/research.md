# Research: Multi-Language UI Support

**Feature**: Multi-Language UI Support  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Technical research and decision documentation for implementing multi-language support

## Technology Stack Analysis

### Decision: Extend Existing Language Context System
**Rationale**: The project already has a working language context system with React Context, localStorage persistence, and translation functions. Extending this system is more maintainable than creating a new one.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **New i18n library (react-i18next)**: Rejected due to complexity and existing system functionality
- **Server-side language detection**: Rejected as client-side preference is more user-friendly
- **URL-based language routing**: Rejected as it would require significant routing changes

### Decision: Use shadcn/ui DropdownMenu Component
**Rationale**: The project already uses shadcn/ui components, and DropdownMenu provides the required accessibility features and standard dropdown behavior.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Custom dropdown component**: Rejected due to accessibility complexity
- **Select component**: Rejected as it doesn't provide the visual design needed
- **Modal-based language selection**: Rejected as it's overkill for this use case

### Decision: localStorage for Language Persistence
**Rationale**: localStorage provides client-side persistence without server complexity, and the existing system already uses it.

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Cookies**: Rejected due to server-side complexity and GDPR considerations
- **Session storage**: Rejected as it doesn't persist across browser sessions
- **Server-side user preferences**: Rejected due to complexity and no user authentication

## Implementation Patterns

### Decision: Extend Language Type Union
**Rationale**: Add Traditional Chinese to existing language type while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export type Language = "zh" | "zh-TW" | "en"
```

### Decision: Navigation Menu Translation Strategy
**Rationale**: Use existing translation system with new Traditional Chinese translations for navigation items.

**Implementation**:
- Add Traditional Chinese translations to existing translations object
- Update language context to handle new language code
- Modify navigation component to use translated text

### Decision: Dropdown Positioning in Header
**Rationale**: Place language dropdown in the existing header component alongside other navigation elements.

**Implementation**:
- Integrate with existing header layout
- Maintain responsive design
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Accessibility Research

### Decision: ARIA Labels and Keyboard Navigation
**Rationale**: Ensure the language dropdown meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards for accessibility.

**Implementation**:
- Use proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Implement keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- Provide visual focus indicators
- Support screen reader announcements

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Client-Side Language Switching
**Rationale**: Avoid page reloads for better user experience and performance.

**Implementation**:
- Use React Context for immediate state updates
- Implement smooth transitions
- Maintain under 2-second switching requirement

## Browser Compatibility

### Decision: Modern Browser Support
**Rationale**: Focus on modern browsers with localStorage and React support.

**Implementation**:
- Graceful fallback to default language if localStorage unavailable
- Error handling for invalid language codes
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Component Testing with React Testing Library
**Rationale**: Test language switching behavior, accessibility, and user interactions.

**Implementation**:
- Unit tests for language context functions
- Integration tests for dropdown behavior
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation
- E2E tests for complete user flows
