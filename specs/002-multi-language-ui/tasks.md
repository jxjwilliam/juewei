# Tasks: Multi-Language UI Support

**Feature**: Multi-Language UI Support  
**Branch**: `002-multi-language-ui`  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Generated from**: spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Summary

This feature adds multi-language support with 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese), 繁体中文 (Traditional Chinese), and English languages. The implementation includes a language dropdown in the navigation bar, navigation menu translation, and localStorage persistence for user preferences.

**Total Tasks**: 15  
**User Story 1 (P1)**: 6 tasks  
**User Story 2 (P2)**: 4 tasks  
**User Story 3 (P3)**: 3 tasks  
**Polish & Cross-Cutting**: 2 tasks

## Dependencies

**Story Completion Order**:
1. **User Story 1** (P1) - Language Selection in Navigation - Can be implemented independently
2. **User Story 2** (P2) - Navigation Menu Translation - Depends on User Story 1
3. **User Story 3** (P3) - Language Persistence - Depends on User Story 1

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- T002 and T003 can be implemented in parallel (different files)
- T004 and T005 can be implemented in parallel (different files)
- T007 and T008 can be implemented in parallel (different files)

## Phase 1: Setup

### Project Initialization

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan

## Phase 2: Foundational

### Core Language System Updates

- [x] T002 [P] Update Language type to include Traditional Chinese in lib/i18n/translations.ts
- [x] T003 [P] Add Traditional Chinese translations to lib/i18n/translations.ts
- [x] T004 [P] Update language validation in lib/i18n/language-context.tsx
- [x] T005 [P] Update languages configuration object in lib/i18n/translations.ts

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Language Selection in Navigation (P1)

**Goal**: Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown menu in the top navigation bar, supporting 简体中文, 繁体中文, and English.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a language dropdown to the navigation bar and verifying that users can select between the three supported languages. The selection should persist across page navigation and browser sessions.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T006 [US1] Update language switcher component to support three languages in components/language-switcher.tsx
- [x] T007 [US1] Add language switcher to header component in components/header.tsx
- [x] T008 [US1] Implement standard dropdown behavior (click to open, click outside to close) in components/language-switcher.tsx
- [x] T009 [US1] Add keyboard navigation support to language dropdown in components/language-switcher.tsx
- [x] T010 [US1] Add accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, screen reader support) to language dropdown in components/language-switcher.tsx
- [x] T011 [US1] Test language dropdown functionality and user interaction in components/language-switcher.tsx

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Navigation Menu Translation (P2)

**Goal**: Navigation menu items (Home, Products, About Us, Contact, Partnership) are displayed in the user's selected language.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by switching languages and verifying that all navigation menu items display in the correct language for each supported language.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T012 [US2] Replace hardcoded navigation text with translation function calls in components/header.tsx
- [x] T013 [US2] Update navigation items to use translated labels in components/header.tsx
- [x] T014 [US2] Test navigation menu translation for all three languages in components/header.tsx
- [x] T015 [US2] Verify navigation menu updates when language changes in components/header.tsx

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Language Persistence (P3)

**Goal**: User's language selection is saved and restored across browser sessions and page navigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a language, closing the browser, reopening the website, and verifying the language preference is maintained.

### Implementation Tasks

- [x] T016 [US3] Implement localStorage persistence for language selection in lib/i18n/language-context.tsx
- [x] T017 [US3] Add fallback handling for localStorage unavailability in lib/i18n/language-context.tsx
- [x] T018 [US3] Test language persistence across browser sessions and page navigation in lib/i18n/language-context.tsx

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Final Integration and Testing

- [x] T019 Test complete multi-language user flow and verify all acceptance scenarios
- [x] T020 Performance optimization and accessibility audit for language switching functionality

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP Scope
**Suggested MVP**: User Story 1 (Language Selection in Navigation) - This provides the core functionality and can be independently tested and deployed.

### Incremental Delivery
1. **Phase 1-2**: Core language system updates (foundational)
2. **Phase 3**: Language dropdown functionality (MVP)
3. **Phase 4**: Navigation translation (enhancement)
4. **Phase 5**: Persistence (polish)
5. **Phase 6**: Final integration and optimization

### Parallel Execution Examples

**Phase 2 Parallel Tasks**:
- T002 and T003 can run simultaneously (different files, no dependencies)
- T004 and T005 can run simultaneously (different files, no dependencies)

**Phase 3 Parallel Tasks**:
- T007 and T008 can run simultaneously (different aspects of dropdown behavior)
- T009 and T010 can run simultaneously (different accessibility features)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Language context functions, translation lookups, localStorage handling
**Integration Tests**: Language switcher component, header integration
**E2E Tests**: Complete user flow from language selection to navigation translation

### Success Criteria Validation

- **SC-001**: Language switching completes in under 2 seconds
- **SC-002**: Language preference persists across 100% of browser sessions
- **SC-003**: Navigation menu items display correctly in all three languages
- **SC-004**: Language selection maintained across 100% of page navigation
- **SC-005**: Graceful fallback when localStorage unavailable
- **SC-006**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility maintained
