**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-luxury-ui-redesign/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Transform the Juewei website into a sophisticated, luxury food brand experience using dark luxury aesthetics, elegant typography, and premium interactive elements. The redesign focuses on brand perception enhancement through high-contrast food photography, sophisticated color palettes, and smooth luxury-grade animations while maintaining accessibility and performance standards.

## Technical Context

**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS 4.x, Radix UI primitives, Lucide React icons, Framer Motion (for animations)  
**Storage**: N/A (static website with image optimization)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright (for E2E testing)  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (modern browsers with CSS Grid/Flexbox support)  
**Project Type**: Web application (Next.js with App Router)  
**Performance Goals**: 60fps animations, <3s initial load time, <1s page transitions  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile-first responsive design, progressive enhancement  
**Scale/Scope**: Restaurant website with 5 main pages, luxury design system, multi-language support
